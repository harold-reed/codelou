README
hello

This project is a resume site for Harold Reed.
It will resize and move content based on if the browser is mobile/desktop.
It requires only that the repo is downloaded as-is, no modification is necessary.
This readme is located in the top level of the project and will show when viewing the repo from a browser.


Choose at least 1 item on the CSS Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 item off the list of JavaScript Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 additional item from any of the lists below and implement it in your project
We recommend you pick a 4th item (or more!) to add, just in case something goes wrong with one of your other items - 3 is only the minimum requirement

CSS Features List
A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.
Import Bootstrap from a CDN, then use Bootstrap’s column system to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views (cannot be used on the same page as the Flexbox/CSS Grid requirement above). Note: Bootstrap is an optional Treehouse video
Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table 
Perform a Web Accessibility Compliance review on your own site and document all the tools and testing you used to verify your site is accessible. This may involve a written write-up, screenshots, and other ways of showing that you evaluated your site for accessibility compliance. Include the report in your GitHub repository.
Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation. Note: CSS Animations are not included in the assigned Treehouse track, you will have to research this on your own
Create a custom video player with at least one custom element (such as the progress bar, play button, etc). This is also not covered in the required Treehouse content.
Other features can be added to this list with mentor or staff permission, but we want to see you stretch your skills, so you’ll want to pick something challenging.

JavaScript Features List
Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and use it somehow.
Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation (calculates something) and displays the result on your page or otherwise uses that value to do something on the site.
Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page
Create a Javascript loop that dynamically displays HTML on your page - for example displaying a number of list items <li> based on how many times you loop
Create at least 3 variables (var, const, or let), set their values in JavaScript, and display the values somewhere on your page
Create one or more JavaScript objects (such as with multiple values contained in { }’s), modify at least one value of that object, and display it on your site
Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code. 
Allow the user to rearrange or move items by clicking and dragging an element on your site
Other features can be added to this list with mentor or staff permission, but we want to see you stretch your skills, so you’ll want to pick something challenging.

Ask your mentors or staff if there’s something you want to do but doesn’t fit into these requirements. As long as it’s a good demonstration of your programming skills, it almost certainly will count!  Basically, we just want to see you do something interesting and challenging, so don’t let these requirements stifle your creativity!

Clarifications and Commonly Asked Questions
How projects are reviewed
The project reviewer will use git to clone your project to their local machine and open index.html (or whatever your readme indicates)
Your media queries/responsive design will be tested using browser tools (such as Chrome Devtools) to simulate two or more device sizes
If all the minimum requirements listed above are met, your project passes
We are looking to ensure you understand what you created, so a poorly implemented project may still not pass if we believe you do not understand the code
Media Queries
Your media queries must be implemented in a way that shows actual change at the different view sizes. We are looking for real, substantial change that shows you understand the purpose of using media queries - to improve the user’s experience when viewing your site.
Some examples of things that WON’T count for this requirement include:
One single image grows and shrinks with the size of your page (ex: “width-100%”
Your font size changes slightly
Your site’s background color changes

	These things are not forbidden, but doing them alone will not count for 
your media queries
You do not have to account for all possible devices and browser sizes. As long as we can see you have 2 functional media queries and can see those difference when we simulate a large and a small screen size, you should be good
Naming your project
Choose a name for your GitHub repo that is relevant to the subject of your project. Do not name your repo "CodeLouisvilleProject" or similar. Choose a name based on what your project is about. For example “House of Pancakes”, “Brian’s Programming Portfolio Site”, etc
GitHub
Your required 5 commits is only a minimum. We hope to see dozens or hundreds of commits.
Yes, Git and Github are strictly required, you cannot email us your project files. We need to see that you’re actually using Git as it’s intended. This is a critical skill most employers expect you to understand.
If you choose to host your application on a live URL, great! You can share that for demonstration purposes or ease of running - and this is encouraged! But your code must still be available on GitHub for review.
Check out GitHub pages (https://pages.github.com/) for a quick way to host your site
If you have any sensitive information that can’t be made public, talk to your mentor or program staff about how to turn in your project
